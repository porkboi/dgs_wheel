# Discrete Gaussian Sampling Over bivariate functions

## Aim:

Inspired by CMU's Tartan Tuesday wheel and finding it expected value over time, we aim to write an algorithm that calculates an expected value given 2 inputs (weeks, spins)

Via a Discrete Gaussian Sampling equation normally used in Lattice-based Cryptography.

$$ f(x, y) $$
